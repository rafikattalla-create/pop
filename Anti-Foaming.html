<h3 class = "woah3"> Idea </h3>
<div class = "parent-container" >
    <p class = "paraimg2">At MetaCycler a bioreactor was often use to complete certain tasks. However during these tasks foam was being
        created unprecedently forcing employees to have to cancel the bioreactor runs.  </p>
      <img src = "Images/PIZZAIMG.jpg" style="padding-right: 200px;">
</div>
<h3 class = "woah3">What ?</h3>
<div class = "parent-container" style = "padding-right: 200px;">
<p class = "paraimg2">To solve this problem the team asked me and my colleague to create a dispensing mechanism
    that would allow us to add anti-foam solution  periodically. </p>
</div>
<h3 class = "woah3">How ?</h3>
<div class = "parent-container">
    <p class = "paraimg2" >
       After going through multiple itterations including a double valve system, a singular valve systems both using washer for insulation we decided to use a 
       perastaltic pump. We found that the previous dispensing mechanisms leaked a lot because there were little gaps given
       that 3D printing does not have perfect accuracy and the washer had 0 to no impact on insulation. The pump can be submerged, reduces need of sterylization
       and is easily housed and compatible with arduino.
    </p>
    <p class = "paraimg3"  style="margin-right: 200px;">
      We used an arduino, a motor drive and a 12V power source for the electronics of the project. This allowed to create
      a live feedback of the pumps behaviour and control its frequency of dispensing the liquid. By creating its own network 
      we created a small page that can be visit while connected to the arduino to evaluate how many mililiters have been dispensed, the running time and more. 
    </p>

<h3 class = "woah3">Results</h3>
<div class = "parent-container">
    <p class = "paraimg2" style = "margin-right: 200px;">
        Here is a video demonstrating the pump in action and the page that keeps track of certain behaviours
        of the pump as it was important to do so for the company data management.
