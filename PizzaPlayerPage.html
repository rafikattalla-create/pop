<h3 class = "woah3"> Idea </h3>
<div class = "parent-container" >
    <p class = "paraimg2">In the ME101 course, which is our second concept and 
    design course in mechanical engineering,  
    we must build and program a robot using the Lego EV3
     kit. In groups of four we must come up with a problem
      or need that can be solved by the project. </p>

<h3 class = "woah3">What ?</h3>
<div class = "parent-container">
<p class = "paraimg2">The pizza player is what me and my group decided to 
    start creating. This robot introduces a mechanism that will make  
    cutting slices of pizza one step ahead. It creates 
    different markings (shaped as slices) all around the 
    pizza to facilitate cutting slices for users 
    (as a prototype). However, this idea can be furthered
     by adding a blade instead of marker. </p>
    <img class = "imgmain3" style = "margin-right: 200px;" src = "Images/parapizzawhat.jpg">
</div>
<h3 class = "woah3">How ?</h3>
<div class = "parent-container">
    <p class = "paraimg2" style="margin-right: 200px;">
        All parts for the robot were either 3D 
        modeled and printed with PLA or made in
        AutoCad (2D) and then lasercut. The Pizza player
        uses the lego EV3 kit which is programmable using RobotC. 
        The kit provided all the motors, cables, the interactive lego block 
        and sensors allowing the robot to function properly.  
    </p>

<h3 class = "woah3">Results</h3>
<div class = "parent-container">
    <p class = "paraimg2">
        After multiple iterations and finding different ways 
        for the robot to complete it's tasks ,here is the process it goes through.
        First the user selects the number of desired slices using the lego block and it's arrows. 
        Then when the process starts the pizza is centered using the pegs. By using a gear ratio
        the bottom plate rotates at given angles to start the markings. The beam which has an attached motor with the  color sensor and
        our eyeliner that opens by being rotated goes accross back and forth marking the pizza.
        When the proces is over, the arm goes to the edge completing the Pizza Players job.
