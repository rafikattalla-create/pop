<h3 class = "woah3"> Idea </h3>
<div class = "parent-container" >
    <p class = "paraimg2"> For this project the company wanted to present why PHA can be a critical 
        gear change in reducing the negative impact of  human activities on the environement. 
          </p>
      <img src = "Images/web1.png" style="padding-right: 200px;">
</div>
<h3 class = "woah3">What ?</h3>
<div class = "parent-container">
<p class = "paraimg2">To do so, I created a web page on the company's website that addresses the future of PHA but also 
    a page that addresses ways a person at home could have a positive impact.  </p>
    <img style = "padding-right: 200px;" src = "Images/web2.png">
</div>
<h3 class = "woah3">How ?</h3>
<div class = "parent-container">
    <p class = "paraimg2" style="margin-right: 200px;">
        By using Wordpress a software that allows the company to create and host their own website, I created two webpages , one of 
        which addresses a larger scale impact of PHA and the other presenting 3D models that I created which you can 
        accesss through the company's GrabCad and print at home with biodegradable plastic.  
    </p>
</div>
<h3 class = "woah3">Results</h3>
<div class = "parent-container">
    <p class = "paraimg2" style = "margin-right: 200px;">
        The result of this web design can be seen on the company's website it self at this link 
        <a href = "https://www.metacycler.ca/" style = "text-decoration: underline;"> metacycler</a> at the "The Future of PHA" page 
        and the following pages that can be acessed from there. As well as the link to the <a href = "https://grabcad.com/metacycler.bioinnovations-1" style = "text-decoration: underline;">
