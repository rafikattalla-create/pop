Mech Days is an organized event by the University of Waterloo for mechanical engineering students in their first year. 
It consists of a team challenge (usually of four) that tackle a problem statement with their group peers. 
The duration of this event is a day and a half.

<p class="paraimg2" style="margin-right: 200px">
That year, the problem statement presented to the cohort was to create a system that would use precisely 
only one mass of 200g to displace at least 2 Ping-Pong balls 16 cm horizontally and 20 cm vertically, 
solely using a Tetrix kit, and other materials that we can get a hold of at home.

<h3 class = "woah3">How ?</h3>
<div class = "parent-container">
<p class="paraimg2">
My team and I worked on a conveyor belt that would use mass to rotate around two axles. 
The ping pong balls would then be picked up using adhesive material. Where the pullie and mass lie, a 
gear ratio was used to increase rotations of the belt.

<p class="paraimg2">
The team managened to displace a ping pong ball. Throughout the process the gear ratios and ball picking  mechanism was changed. 
A few of the challenges we faced taught us a lot about mechanical
 concepts, notability of the greater efficiency attributed to a toothed belt vs. our friction-based belt or 
 the feeding mechanism that used double sided tape which eventually lost it's adhesive properties after numerous uses.
